Simple Problem1
====
Given an integer array of size N, compute the sum of all even numbers in this array [1 point]


Simple Problem2
====
Given an integer array of size N, identify the largest 2 numbers in this array. Do not sort the 
array. [2 points]

Simple Problem3
====
Given an array of numbers having size N in which every number is between 1 and N, determine if there are any 
duplicates in it. You are allowed to destroy the array if you like. Do not sort the array or use 
bit vectors. Try to work within the array without using any other temporary data structures. Do 
not use 2 nesting for loops since the time complexity would be high. Try to find a solution by 
executing just one loop. Hint: manipulate the elements of the same array as you loop through.
